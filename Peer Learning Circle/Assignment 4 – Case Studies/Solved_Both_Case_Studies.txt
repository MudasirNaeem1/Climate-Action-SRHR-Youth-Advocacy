Solving Case Study I:

Q1. Nukka’s feelings while managing pregnancy and melting ice.

Ans.
1. Nukka feels scared, stressed, and unsupported.
2. She misses school and health workshops.
3. She got pregnant young because no one guided her.
4. She feels ignored when asking for help.
5. She has a sense of fear and uncertainty about her life ahead.

Q2. Identify challenges faced by youth.

Ans.
• Schools shut down due to floods, Heavy Rains and snow melt loss of learning (loss of learning).
• No access to sexual and reproductive health services, and these topics are not even discussed in schools or communities, which makes young people unaware and unprepared.
• When disasters happen, families lose money, and young people are forced into unsafe decisions.


Q3. Highlight how environment and body autonomy are connected?

Ans.
- When environment suffers (melting ice, floods, disasters), schools and clinics close and youth lose access to health and education.
- Girls like Nukka cannot learn about their bodies, rights, or safe pregnancy even these topics are not discussed in our schools or society, which makes youth unaware and leads to early/unsafe pregnancies.
- Climate change makes gender inequality worse because women and girls suffer more.
- Body autonomy means being able to make decisions about your health and future, but environment crises take away this freedom.
