Answers:

Q1. How do you think climate change can affect people’s human rights?

Ans.
Climate change can harm people’s basic needs like food, water, health, and shelter. Floods or heat can destroy homes and crops. The poor suffer the most, and it increases unfairness.

Q2. How do you think SRHR (sexual & reproductive health and rights) connects with human rights?

Ans.
SRHR is directly linked to human rights because it is about choice, health, and equality. Everyone should have access to safe healthcare, family planning, and correct information. Without it, people lose control over their own health and lives.

Q3. Imagine you are part of a decision-making group - what one action would you take to promote human rights in crises?

Ans.
If I am a part of it, I would focus on making sure relief and aid are given fairly to everyone, without discrimination. In times of crisis, equal access to food, medical help, and shelter can save lives and protect dignity.


Q4. Who can people turn to if they feel their human rights are being denied?

Ans.
People can turn to local human rights groups, community leaders, or trusted NGOs. On a bigger level, they can also reach out to courts or national human rights commissions.

Q5. Why is respect and dignity important when we talk about rights?

Ans.
Respect and dignity are the heart of human rights. If people respect one another, then rights can be protected in real life, not just on paper. Dignity makes everyone feel valued, no matter their background.

Q6. Share one quote, story, or personal experience that inspires you about human rights.

Ans.
As we see, education is becoming increasingly expensive, and many families cannot afford it for their children. However, children are eager to go to school like everyone else.

TCF (The Citizens Foundation) provides quality education for these children, offering well-trained teachers and resources for those who cannot afford costly books or schooling. They support students not only at the school level but also in coaching, intermediate studies, and even university fees.

Their aim is clear 
“Education is a basic need and a fundamental human right for every child.”
